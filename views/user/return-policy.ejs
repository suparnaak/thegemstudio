                    <p>At The Gem Studio, we want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If you are not
                        satisfied, you may return your item within 30 days of receipt.</p>

                    <h3>Return Process</h3>

                        <li>Contact our customer service team at [contact email] to initiate a return.</li>

                    </ol>

                    <h3>Conditions for Return</h3>
                    <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received
                        it. It must also be in the original packaging.</p>

                    <h3>Refunds</h3>

                        approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit
                        will automatically be applied to your original method of payment.</p>

                    <h3>Exchanges</h3>
